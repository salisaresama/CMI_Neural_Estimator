# Conditional Mutual Information Neural Estimator

## Introduction
In this repository I am explaining the method explained in [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02277) and another paper which is under submission process.
This technique is based on variational lower bounds for relative entropy known as Donsker-Varadhan bound **(DV bound)** and **NWJ bound**. 

## Implementation
The neural network is implemented with **PyTorch**.
